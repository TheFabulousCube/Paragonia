*I used your recipes as much as possible.  JEI or NEI mods will show the recipes if you don't remember them.*

### Known issues:
**Flat Plane artifacts:** Quill, Papers, Candelabra flames, Lantern, Book-rest, Stone Podium, Scale  
**Oversize blocks:** Bookshelves, Table, Podium, Mirror, Bench  
 *(Side-by-side the texture collides, the hit box shows full, but only when you're pointed within the blocks' normal hit box.)*

Some sounds.
