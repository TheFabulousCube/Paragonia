# Paragonia
Minecraft mod adaptation of Elsweyr's Resource Pack: Paragonia

## Paragonia v0.85 update

### **Creatures!** Creatures are now available on the Creatures tab!
*The creatures are still only decorative blocks, sorry.  I do have plans to animate them with AI just like regular Minecraft mobs,
but it'll be a while.*

### All **Decoration** blocks are in ##
*I added these programatically (I wrote a program to do it for me), so they still need some tweaks*
*I did **not** add recipes for the new Decorations.  Until I do, you'll have to pull them in Creative mode.*

### Known issues:
**Apiary:** Sits flat on the ground, not on legs.
**Oversize blocks:** Bookshelves, Table, Podium, Mirror, Bench  
 *(Side-by-side the texture collides, the hit box shows full, but only when you're pointed within the blocks' normal hit box.)*
**Oversize blocks includes horses**  Temp fix is to place the horse on a (grass) block, then break the block.  The horse still floats a bit.
*I'm writing a program to adjust the models to sit flat on the ground, when 1 is fixed, I'll have them ALL fixed.*

Some sounds.

## Paragonia v0.52 update

### **Banners!** All 16 colors

### Known issues:
**Apiary:** Sits flat on the ground, not on legs. Some transparency issues.
**Oversize blocks:** Bookshelves, Table, Podium, Mirror, Bench  
 *(Side-by-side the texture collides, the hit box shows full, but only when you're pointed within the blocks' normal hit box.)*
