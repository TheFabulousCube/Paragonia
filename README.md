## Paragonia v0.52 update

### **Banners!** All 16 colors

### Known issues:
**Apiary:** Sits flat on the ground, not on legs. Some transparency issues.
**Oversize blocks:** Bookshelves, Table, Podium, Mirror, Bench  
 *(Side-by-side the texture collides, the hit box shows full, but only when you're pointed within the blocks' normal hit box.)*

Some sounds.
